Today
can you create me a readme file https://github.com/Soutikkk/My_First_Vibe_Coded_Weather_Website_CloudCast.git
Got it, Soutik 🌤 — let’s put together a clean, engaging README.md draft for your CloudCast project so it looks professional and inviting on GitHub. Since I can’t directly fetch the repo contents, I’ll base this on the project name and what’s likely inside (a weather website). You can then tweak the details (like features, tech stack, and screenshots) to match your actual implementation.
